The assignment (trial)

Write a REST web service for currency conversion.

Exchange rates might be taken from free sources (e.g. https://openexchangerates.org/) and should be updated once a day. The rates should be stored in a database.

User interface design is not important and up to you.

Currencies:
Czech koruna
Euro
Polish z≈Çoty
US dollar.
The application should be tested as well. Code coverage is important.

The project should be uploaded to GitHub/Bitbucket.


Result:
convertation made by using russian ruble rate got from http://www.cbr.ru/
Setup notes:

You need provide call ./manage.py update_rates from crontab everyday. For example call 'crontab -e' and in editor add line (replacing PROJECT_PATH to the project path)

0 5 * * * PROJECT_PATH/manage.py update_rates

Or if you use virtual environment than you need to create some bash script where you tune environment and call this command.

The assignment is not clean to my look: REST is defenotion for service which operate some resources, but there is no resources, but exists some action: convertation from one currency to another currency. This case close to defenition RPC (over HTTP). So I don't know which http-verb useful in that case and used sipmle GET.
TODO: make bash script for calling from crontab
